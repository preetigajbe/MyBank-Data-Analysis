# MyBank-Data-Analysis
Bank Data Analysis Using MySQL

Project Overview

This project analyzes a comprehensive bank dataset using MySQL Workbench. The dataset includes key tables such as accounts, ATMs, customers, branches, loans, transactions, and credit cards. The goal is to derive insights about banking operations, customer behavior, and financial transactions.

Dataset

	•	Accounts: Information on customer accounts including account numbers and balances.
	•	ATMs: Details of ATM locations and operations.
	•	Customers: Personal details of bank customers.
	•	Branches: Information about bank branches.
	•	Loans: Records of loans taken by customers, including amounts and statuses.
	•	Transactions: Details of customer transactions (withdrawals, deposits, transfers).
	•	Credit Cards: Information about customers’ credit card usage and limits.

Project Features
•	Data Import: CSV files for each table (accounts, ATMs, customers, branches, loans, transactions, credit cards) were imported into MySQL Workbench for analysis.
	•	SQL Queries: Complex SQL queries were used to perform tasks like:
	•	Retrieving account balances and transaction histories.
	•	Analyzing loan performance and credit card usage.
	•	Studying transaction patterns across accounts.
	•	Exploring ATM usage and location
	•	Data Cleaning: Cleaned and formatted raw data to ensure consistency across the dataset.
	•	Joins and Aggregations: Performed table joins and aggregations to gain deeper insights into banking behavior and financial metrics.

Key Queries

	•	Top Customers by Transaction Volume: Identifying customers with the highest transaction values.
	•	Loan Default Patterns: Analyzing which customer demographics are more likely to default on loans.
	•	ATM Performance: Finding which ATMs have the highest transaction volumes.
•	Branch Performance: Identifying branches with the highest customer engagement.
	•	Credit Card Usage: Analyzing the spending habits of customers with credit cards.

Tools Used

	•	MySQL Workbench: For writing and executing SQL queries.
	•	GitHub: To store and manage project files and data.

How to Run

	1.	Clone this repository to your local machine.
	2.	Import the provided CSV files into your MySQL database.
	3.	Run the SQL scripts to perform data analysis.

Future Enhancements

	•	Adding further insights with advanced data visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI.
	•	Integrating predictive models for customer loan defaults and transaction predictions.
